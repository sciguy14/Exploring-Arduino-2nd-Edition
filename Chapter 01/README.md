_Exploring Arduino:_ Second Edition, Chapter 1
==============================================
The code in this folder is for [Chapter 1 of the SECOND EDITION of _Exploring Arduino_](https://www.exploringarduino.com/content2/ch1)  
  
Chapter 1 only uses the "blink" example that comes with the Arduino IDE. It is included here, but can also be loaded directly from the Arduino IDE by navigating to  `File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink` within the IDE.
